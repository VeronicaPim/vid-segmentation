Video Segmentation for a Scratch Demo Tutorial (Basic Game):
Segmented Learning:
As a person who doesnâ€™t want to miss anything, I want to learn at my own pace while staying in sync with the instructor.

Segmentation Rules:
Mark a segment boundary when the instructor tells students to do an action (eg. move the mouse, click a button).
Segment video when important information is given, such as explaining the meaning or significance of a step.
